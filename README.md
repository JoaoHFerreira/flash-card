This API serves as an interactive platform to manage a learning system using flashcards. It allows users to create and organize flashcards and learning subjects, and track historical interactions with those flashcards. The focus of the API is to support effective, structured learning through the following functionalities:

## Table of Contents
1. **Learning Topics Management**
2. **Flashcards Creation and Practice Scheduling**
3. **Batch Import from CSV**
4. **Historical Tracking of Practice**

## 1. Learning Topics Management
- Users can add new subjects, which act as categories for the flashcards.
- This helps organize flashcards into relevant topics, making it easier to find and study specific areas.

## 2. Flashcards Creation and Practice Scheduling
- Users can create flashcards that are linked to learning topics. Each flashcard includes a question and an answer.
- Once flashcards are added, they can be used for practice. The system schedules practice sessions for each flashcard, with an emphasis on spaced repetition for effective learning.

## 3. Batch Import from CSV
- Users can add multiple flashcards at once using a CSV file. This is helpful for importing large sets of data, such as educational content or pre-prepared questions, without manually adding each one.
- The CSV file should include questions, answers, and their respective topics, allowing for streamlined input of a large number of flashcards.

## 4. Historical Tracking of Practice
- The system tracks interactions with the flashcards, including practice history. This helps users understand their progress over time and adjust their learning strategies accordingly.
- The goal is to reinforce learning through repetition, ensuring that difficult concepts are revisited more frequently based on the userâ€™s history with each flashcard.
